# Numerical_Solution_of_a_Bernoulli_Equation
## The First File
1. use six method: explicit Euler’s method, implicit Euler’s method, trapezoidal rule method, RK4 method,
   four-step Adams-Bashforth method and four-step Adams-Moulton method
   to solve dy/dt = y/(0.01+t)-y^3 for different N
2. plot the results for different N
3. calculate the time of different methods for N = 100
## The Second File
1. calculate the max error as a function of N for each method
2. plot the results
3. calculate average slope (p) for each line (method)
## The Third File
1. calculate the max error as a function of tolerance for three implicit methods
2. plot the results for different N
